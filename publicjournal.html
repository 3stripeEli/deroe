            Well it's finally here, a public journal!
            On the time of reading this I am trying to 
            write in proper grammar because my family
            would be proud, English is my second language.
            But I have issues with writing in my native language,
             Arabic. Speaking of that, I just realised. My brother's
            birthday is coming very soon!  On Valentines day in fact.
            Well I guess I should prepare myself a surprise for him.
