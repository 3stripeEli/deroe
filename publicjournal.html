            Well it's finally here, a public journal!
            On the time of reading this I am trying to 
            write in proper grammar because my family
            would be proud, English is my second language.
            But I have issues with writing in my native language,
             Arabic. Speaking of that, I just realised. My brother's
            birthday is coming very soon!  On Valentines day in fact.
            Well I guess I should prepare myself a surprise for him. Also,
            I'm thinking about deleting S-BITEZ because I'm too lazy to 
            make it. Or maybe add the wikis to one page or something but
            I guess it's alot to unpack.

            <h1>Journal Post #0001 (Part 2)</h1>
            <article>
               1/2/2021
                </br>
               Unpacking litterally everything out here, and by everything
               I mean a third of the unpacking. But at least I did some work.
               This journal post is also a part of the previous one, (obviously)
               And no, I'm not deleting S-BITEZ or putting thw wikis in one page.
               Anyways, my friend believes I should rename Deroe CD to "MM books" 
               because the only thing hosted on deroe is his books so soon in a bit
               I'm making a petition and you can sign it!

                </br>
                A few days till Valentine's Day(my younger brother's Birthday), my brother is not important
                anymore and having a 2 things day feels like a stretch. On one side, It's my brother and on
                the other side is true love. Usually this decision isn't a problem because I don't have a 
                person for Valentine's day. This time I want to strike my first time in because I've never 
                done it before, but I don't know who, and I fear rejection. Might just quit it and find a 
                present for my brother. You know what, this gives me an idea! I should look for a present for 
                my brother and if I ever find a person I like during the search, maybe I'll try and keep that
                as a target for next year. For now I'll leave it to my brother's birthday.

                Haven't wrote in a long time! Update: I'm no longer exited about anything anymore.
                2021 is a bad year for me, for personal reasons I wouldn't show on a public journal
                fully available to the entire internet where a nerd could literally hire a hitman to 
                kill a person who you don't know or like off the dark web. Anyways, school is shifting
                back to physical on the final months apparently? My friend, Mustafa, got used to it. 
                Maybe make the shift after summer break but a pandemic just broke out of some village
                in Wuhan and went crazy out of nowhere so it has to end that way. So, on some positive
                news for once; Turtoi now has a news page!(or artiles idk it just kind of there) And I
                still don't have any news so yeah. Come on 2021, make a new disaster so that I(and every 
                other form of media: The news, blog posts, and forums) can make something to be 
                exaggerating about. Also I'm redesigning the horrid navigation on Turtoi and redesigning
                everything else. Let's hope I don't over-engineer it and make the most scattered and
                clustered website to exist.
