            <h1>General Info:</h1>
            <article>FASTDRIVE! is the first installation on the FASTDRIVE series, now written by Mustafa Al-Zahawi. This issue takes place in California, Los Angeles. The main character in this book attempts to steal a significant amount of cars and leave in 60 seconds. This was shortened down so the story doesn't get spoiled.</article>

            <h1>History:</h1>
            <article>The history to this comic is pretty interesting. Mustafa Al-Zahawi remembered the series one day and ditched it. Got the idea of vanilla car chases and mishmashed it. Added the title and decided to release it on November 28th of 2020. This website will be updated once it is released.</article>
