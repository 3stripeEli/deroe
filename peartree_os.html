            <article>
                PearTreeOS is a command-line based operating system made in c++, currently in development and rocking
                hard with many apps being developed and supported for the operating system. This project
                was made by Ali Muhammad, also one of the authors of the #DRIVE series. You can check the 
                github repository for the project to support its development. Progress comes really fast for this project
                and I'm really surprised! It's a two man project and this time it's not with Mustafa Al-Zahawi.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">History:</h1>
            <article>This isn't the first time Ali Muhammad ever made an operating system, or at least an operating system
                environment for windows. But at least this is the first time he actually tries to make an actual operating system.
                that works on more than input output storage simulation. The first time he dived into such a topic was on 
                PearOS. At this time he didn't know that name was taken so he renamed it to PearTreeOS. Next time he tried was on 
                PearTreeOS 92. After that project was scrapped PearTreeOS Expand(or the first ever time some effort was made into 
                peartree os) came out as a prototype on the traphouse server. Ali was banned from that server so thats all the info
                I could find. If I was actually in that server at the time I would have made this part longer with more detail but since
                he was permabanned I have no idea. Bring that topic in there and they instantly think you are an alt account according to
                what Ali thinks.
